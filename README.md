This is a simple ReactJS front-end layer that I created to study Material-UI a bit.

The backend isn't open-source yet. I wrote a little app in Go API with rate-limit, Redis and SQLIte. I might open-source the backend once I clean up a bit more.

### To do:
- [x] Add tests
- [x] Extracting some logic currently on .jsx into dedicated classes/services
- [x] Convert to Typescript
- [ ] Refactor some code
- [ ] Improve tests
